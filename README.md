**Overview**

You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection algorithm introduced in 2015 by Joseph Redmon, Santosh Divvala, Ross Girshick, and Ali Farhadi in their famous research paper “You Only Look Once: Unified, Real-Time Object Detection”.

YOLO fundamentally transforms the field of object detection by treating the identification of objects in images as a single regression problem.

Unlike traditional methods that scan images in parts, YOLO examines the entire image in one evaluation, predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously. This streamlined approach not only speeds up the detection process, allowing it to run in real-time at impressive speeds, but also simplifies the model architecture, enabling end-to-end optimization directly on detection performance.
